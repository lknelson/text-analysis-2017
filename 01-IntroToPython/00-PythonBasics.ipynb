    "\n",
    "* *coding or programming*: \n",
    "    * The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will enable a computer to perform a specific task or solve a given problem. It involves writing those instructions in a specific *programming language*, in our case, Python.\n",
    "* *script*:\n",
    "    * A block of executable code, typically saved in a executable file. For example, script1.py\n",
    "* *packages and modules*: \n",
    "    * Python files, or collections of files, that implement a set of pre-made functions (so we don't have to write all of the functions ourselves). To utilize a module we use the import function.\n",
    "* *parse*: \n",
    "    * the process of analysing a string of symbols, in this case the symbols that make up natural language. This can also include understanding, or parsing, computer code.\n",
    "* *variable*: \n",
    "    * A variable is something that holds a value that may change. In simplest terms, a variable is just a box that you can put stuff in. You can use variables to store all kinds of stuff, including numbers and letters.\n",
    "* *assigning a variable*: \n",
    "    * telling Python what you want to name the variable, and what is stored in the variable.\n",
    "* *string*: \n",
    "    * a type of variable the consists of a sequence of characters in a particular order. Characters can be anything, including letters or numbers. The order of a string is fixed.\n",
    "* *list*: \n",
    "    * a type of variable that consists of a sequence of elements. The order is fixed."
