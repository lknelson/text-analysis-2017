    "One of the benefits of the DTM is that it allows us to think about text within the bounds of geometry, which then allows us to think about the \"distance\" between texts. Today's tutorial will explore how we might use distance measures in our text analysis workflow, and toward what end.\n",

    "* Learn how to visualize distances in a few ways, and how that might help us in our text analysis project\n",

    "\n",
    "* Euclidean Distance\n",
    "    * In mathematics, the Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the \"ordinary\" (i.e. straight-line) distance between two points in Euclidean space. With this distance, Euclidean space becomes a metric space.\n",
    "* Cosine Similarity\n",
    "    * Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any other angle.\n",
    "* Multidimensional Scaling\n",
    "    * Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a means of visualizing the level of similarity of individual cases of a dataset. It refers to a set of related ordination techniques used in information visualization, in particular to display the information contained in a distance matrix.\n",
    "* Dendrogram\n",
    "    * A dendrogram (from Greek dendro \"tree\" and gramma \"drawing\") is a tree diagram frequently used to illustrate the arrangement of the clusters produced by hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "* K-Means Clustering\n",
    "    * k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster."

    "Arranging our texts in a document-term matrix make available a range of exploratory procedures. For example, calculating a measure of similarity between texts becomes simple. Since each row of the document-term matrix is a sequence of a novel’s word frequencies, it is possible to put mathematical notions of similarity (or distance) between sequences of numbers in service of calculating the similarity (or distance) between any two novels. One frequently used measure of distance between vectors (a measure easily converted into a measure of similarity) is Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between two vectors in the plane should be familiar from geometry, as it is the length of the hypotenuse that joins the two vectors. For instance, consider the Euclidean distance between the vectors  \\begin{align}\n",
    "\\overrightarrow{x}=(1,3) \\space \\space and\\space\\space\\overrightarrow{y}=(4,2)  \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",

    "\\sqrt{(1-4)^2 + (3-2)^2} = \\sqrt{10}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note\n",
    "Measures of distance can be converted into measures of similarity. If your measures of distance are all between zero and one, then a measure of similarity could be one minus the distance. (The inverse of the distance would also serve as a measure of similarity.)\n",

For example, a researcher may be wondering if certain textual features partition a collection of texts by author or by genre. Pairwise distances alone do not produce any kind of classification.

Any clustering of texts should result in texts that are closer to each other (in the distance matrix) residing in the same cluster.

Rather than producing a single clustering, Ward’s method produces a hierarchy of clusterings, as we will see in a moment.
